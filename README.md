# git_test
THis repo will take you on my journey of learning full stack from scratch. I do have intermediatary knowledge of full sack development but i have not been on touch with this side of the tech world for a very long time now and so I want to get started from scratch without leaving anything left behind.
"Hello Odin!"

We have added few more words here. in case we have to practice commiting and staging on git

All in all learnt few new stuffs about git and github and how different commands work during operating on different folders and such stuffs.
feel pretty confident to work with it now. more over this is a new beginning so the design is already crappy but working on backend will help me become more confident
