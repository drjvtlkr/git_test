<body>
    <title>I am learning about how HTML works and how each of the elements are following the hierarchy </title>
    <p>See here I did a mistake by writing title tag in the body whereas it's right full place will be in the head part of the page,
        this goes to show that i am still new to understand how these tags are arranged by the document reader or how these tags follow the DOM hierarchy
